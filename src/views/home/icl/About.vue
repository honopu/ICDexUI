      <p>
        ICL is ICLighthouse's eco-governance token, as well as a utility token
        consumed by the project. The token is used to incentivise users who
        contribute to the project's ecosystem.
      </p>
      <!--<p class="icl-item-info-margin">
        ICLighthouse is a Defi infrastructure based on the IC network, including
        ICLight (wallet), ICTokens (token issuance platform), CyclesFinance
        (Cycles marketplace), ICDex (spot Dex), ICStable (stablecoin),
        ICPStaking (ICP staking tool), ICMonitor (canister monitor),
        ICL-Accelerator (Defi eco-accelerator). These combinable functional
        modules can drive the development of the Defi eco-system of the IC
        network. ICLighthouse aims to develop into a distributed and autonomous
        community of developers and users (DAO), self-organising, self-managing
        and self-running according to a consensus mechanism set by a governance
        contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        Projects developed by the ICLighthouse team above will use ICL tokens
        for governance, incentive and utility use of the ecosystem. If projects
        developed by ICLighthouse issue tokens independently in response to
        market demand, at least 25% of the tokens will be airdropped to ICL
        holders. Projects incubated by ICL-Accelerator will be issued separate
        tokens at the discretion of their founders, as well as airdrops to ICL
        holders at their discretion.

        ICLs are held for governance and utility purposes. No person or entity
        has committed value to ICLs and you can treat ICLs as worthless. If you
        hold ICLs, you do so at your own risk.
